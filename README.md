## progress
[2018.11.09]  fixing texture on sphere, the texture is fixed but the uv coord is not right, can move on to reconstruct now.

[2018.11.08]  start reconstruct the code, the reconstruct design thought is write in the jupyter notebook.
## Final target:simple software renderer with python
## Todo
- fix texture on ball
**[reconstruct the code]**
- add parameter to modify graphic variable
- add parameter for different display mode
- display triangle with different vertex color
**[feature]**
- strip drawing
- change the model from ball to cube
- wire frame model
- g-buffer
- texture on triangle
- clipping

Not a feature that must be implemented
**[advanced feature]**
- point light with different color light
- shadow
